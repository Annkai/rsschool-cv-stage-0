## ABOUT ME
My goal is to become a front-end developer and receive a job offer.
I chose this direction because I like finding solutions to complex problems, constantly developing, seeing the results of my work and generally enjoying it.

Qualities such as perseverance, meticulousness and attentiveness help me to master this profession. At the same time I am also very confident in my communication as I will need to interact with a team. This foundation was built upon my previous experience as a sales manager.

In order to get closer to my goal, I took two courses at the Educational Center for Programming and High Tech (IT Academy). The "HTML, CSS, JavaScript" and the "Web application development with JavaScript" courses. As a result of this training, I have completed two graduation projects: a website in HTML and CSS (compatible for both desktop and mobile devices) and a side-scrolling game in JavaScript (Similar to "Flappy Bird").

I also took part in several internships (Edavoz.by, ZNS) at Startups, so I have experience working in a team. The first project I worked on is an application that helps organize all your contacts in one place. My task was coding the authorization pages using a layout from Figma and also allowing users to sgn in to the app using sign-in methods such as email address with password, Google and Facebook using Firebase Authentication.

The second project is a mobile version of a food delivery website. I needed to make a dynamically changing catalog and an order form for goods.

In addition to my knowledge base, I actively seek out new technologies and try to stay up-to-date on industry trends and advancements. I am open to learning new information. My professional interests I would preferably learn are JavaScript technologies (s/a Angular, React, Node.js).

        let shops = await respShops.json();

        function getShops(v, l) {

        retailChainsCont.innerHTML += `
